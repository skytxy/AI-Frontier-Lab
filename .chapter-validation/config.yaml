# Chapter Content Validator - Project Configuration
#
# Centralized config for all chapters.
# Skill reads this to understand project structure.
# All fields are optional - Skill provides defaults.

version: "1.0"

defaults:
  max_iterations: 5
  collaboration_mode: dual-agent
  sections: [concepts/, experiments/]

# Seed patterns for the experience store.
# These bootstrap the experience engine on first run.
# As the Skill executes, runtime data accumulates in experience.yaml alongside this file.
